# Tutorial: Get balances

This tutorial shows you how to use the Sample API to retrieve asset balances in a customer's portfolio.

You will learn about the requests and responses your integration must handle to:

* Retrieve the balance of a specific digital asset by sending a `GET` request to the `/balance/{'{'}asset{'}'}` endpoint `{'{'}segment_id{'}'}`.
* Retrieve the balance of all digital assets in a customer's portfolio by sending a `GET` request to the `/balances` endpoint.


## Prerequisites

Both `GET /balance/{'{'}asset{'}'}` and `GET /balances` endpoints are protected by Bearer authentication. To successfully call these endpoints, you must include a valid Bearer authentication token in the request header.

- **dataSetId:** `segment_${'{'}segment_id{'}'}`
  - `${'{'}segment_id{'}'}` value is found in the `config.yml` file.



Here is an example. My name is {{process.env.MY_ENV_NAME}}.

```js
{{process.env.MY_ENV_NAME}}
```
